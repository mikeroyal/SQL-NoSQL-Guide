# SQL/NoSQL Learning Resources

[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in relational databases.

[NoSQL](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/sql-vs-nosql) is a database that is interchangeably referred to as "nonrelational, or "non-SQL" to highlight that the database can handle huge volumes of rapidly changing, unstructured data in different ways than a relational (SQL-based) database with rows and tables.

[Transact-SQL(T-SQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-reference) is a Microsoft extension of SQL with all of the tools and applications communicating to a SQL database by sending T-SQL commands.
